# ðŸ–± 42Paris Project | ft_containers

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to implement three containers of C++:  
- **std::vector**  
- **std::stack**  
- **std::map**  

We have to comply with **C++98** standard so many functions is not implemented.  
We also have to implement:  
- **std::iterator_traits**  
- **std::reverse_iterator**  
- **std::enable_if**  
- **std::is_integral**  
- **std::equal and/or std::lexicographical_compare**  
- **std::pair**  
- **std::make_pair**  

## Usage

`make` to compile the program.  
`clean` to clean objects files.  
`fclean` to clean objects files and program file.  

**Execute**: `./containers`  
The program shows you different menus to test the functions of each containers.  

## Help

First trying to understand how std::allocator works. Make some tests before starting containers.  
For each container documentation on **[cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)** and **[cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/)** are usefull (we have to take thoses documentations as reference).  
[AVL Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html), it helps to understand how binary search tree have to work.  
[Programiz AVL Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree), I use this site to understand how to do AVL Tree.
